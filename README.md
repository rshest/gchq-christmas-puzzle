> In this type of grid-shading puzzle, each square is either black or white. 
> Some of the black squares have already been filled in for you.
> Each row or column is labelled with a string of numbers. 
> The numbers indicate the length of all consecutive runs of black squares, and are displayed in the order that the runs appear in that line. 
> For example, a label "2 1 6" indicates sets of two, one and six black squares, 
> each of which will have at least one white square separating them.”
